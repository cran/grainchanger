Description: Data aggregation via moving window or direct methods. Aggregate a 
    fine-resolution raster to a grid. The moving window method smooths the surface 
    using a specified function within a moving window of a specified size and shape 
    prior to aggregation. The direct method simply aggregates to the grid using the 
    specified function. The package differs from other packages offering moving window 
    analysis in 2 key ways: 1. The moving window code has been optimised so that it runs 
    more quickly than \code{raster::focal} or other packages that build on this; 
    2. It combines moving window and aggregation in a way which can be effectively parallelised.
