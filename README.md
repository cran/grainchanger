The `grainchanger` package provides functionality for data aggregation
to a grid via moving-window or direct methods.

### Moving-window data aggregation

The moving-window data aggregation method smooths the surface using a
specified function within a moving window of a specified size and shape
prior to aggregation.

![Schematic of the moving-window data aggregation
approach](man/figures/mwda_schematic.png)

The moving window approach allows users to capture some information
about landscape structure at the scale at which the process acts in the
landscape.

### Direct data aggregation

The direct method simply aggregates to the grid using the specified
function, essentially acting as a wrapper for the `raster` aggregate
function.

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("laurajanegraham/grainchanger")
```

## Example

### Moving-window data aggregation

The below example shows the moving-window data aggregation in action. It
aggregates a categorical raster to a grid using Shannon evenness as the
function calculated within a square moving window of 5 units. This value
is included as a column on the grid `sf` object.

``` r
library(grainchanger)
library(ggplot2)
library(landscapetools)

# categorical landscape
show_landscape(cat_ls)
#> Loading required package: raster
#> Loading required package: sp
```

``` r

# moving-window aggregation using Shannon evenness
g_sf$mwda <- winmove_agg(g = g_sf,
            dat = cat_ls, 
            d = 5,
            type = "rectangle",
            fun = "shei",
            lc_class = 0:3)

ggplot(g_sf) + geom_sf(aes(fill = mwda))
```

### Direct data aggregation

The below example shows the direct data aggregation in action. It
aggregates a continuous raster to a grid using the range as the function
calculated for each cell of the larger grid. This value is included as a
column on the grid `sf` object. `var_range` is an inbuilt function in
the `grainchanger` package.

``` r
# continuous landscape
show_landscape(cont_ls)
```

<img src="man/figures/README-dda_example-1.png" width="100%" />

``` r

# direct aggregation using range
g_sf$range <- nomove_agg(g = g_sf,
            dat = cat_ls, 
            fun = "var_range")

ggplot(g_sf) + geom_sf(aes(fill = range))
```

<img src="man/figures/README-dda_example-2.png" width="100%" />

## Functions

There are a number of inbuilt functions in the grainchanger package,
with their useage outlined below. While it is possible to use
user-defined functions within both `winmove_agg` and `nomove_agg`, we
welcome suggestions for additional functions. Please [add as an
issue](https://github.com/laurajanegraham/grainchanger/issues) - doing
it this way means we can maximise the speed of the
function.

| Function.Name | Description                                                                | Additional.arguments |
| :------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------- |
| wm\_prop      | Calculate the proportion of a given class within the moving window         | lc\_class (numeric)  |
| wm\_classes   | Calculate the number of classes within the moving window                   |                      |
| wm\_shei      | Calculate the Shannon evenness within the moving window                    | lc\_class (numeric)  |
| wm\_mean      | Calculate the mean value within the moving window                          |                      |
| nm\_shei      | Calculate the Shannon evenness within the larger cell                      | lc\_class (numeric)  |
| nm\_prop      | Calculate the proportion of a given class within the larger cell           | lc\_class (numeric)  |
| var\_range    | Calculate the range of values (can be used with or without a moving window |                      |

## Additional utilities

### Create torus

The `create_torus` function takes as input a square or rectangular
landscape and pads it by a specified radius, creating the effect of a
torus. We developed this function in order to avoid edge effects when
testing methods on simulated landscapes (such as those from
[NLMR](https://ropensci.github.io/NLMR/)).

``` r
torus <- create_torus(cat_ls, 5)

show_landscape(torus)
```
